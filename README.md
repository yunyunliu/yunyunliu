## Hello, I'm Yunyun.  :octocat:

I'm a full stack web developer, technology enthusiast, and life-long autodidact. I'm also always working on being a better bug-squisher  :beetle: .

As a result of my background in research psychology and linguistics, I am especially interested in how people interact with technology and in creating applications that are intuitive and user-friendly. 

### I build web applications using:

**Languages and Frameworks:** JavaScript, HTML & CSS, Node, React, Express  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MonggodDB  
**Tools:** Figma, Postman, Webpack, Babel.

...and I am always excited for opportunities to learn new tech.
