## Hi, I'm Yunyun.  

I'm a full stack web developer, technology enthusiast, and life-long autodidact. 

My academic background is in cognitive psychology and linguistics. As a result, I am especially interested in how people interact with technology and in creating applications that are intuitive and user-friendly. 

## I build applications using:

**Languages and Frameworks:** JavaScript, HTML & CSS, Node, React, Express  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
**Tools:** Figma, Postman, Webpack, Babel, NPM, Chrome DevTools

And I am always excited for opportunities to learn new tech.
